# Rope Simulation Project

## Overview

This project simulates the behavior of a rope-like structure in a canvas environment. It uses JavaScript to implement the simulation and provides visual feedback using HTML5 Canvas.

## Features

- **Mouse Interaction**: The simulation allows for mouse interaction to control the movement of certain elements.
- **Physics Simulation**: Implements basic physics principles like friction, gravity, and tension to simulate realistic rope behavior.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts to different screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience across devices.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Utilizes HTML5 Canvas for dynamic rendering of the simulation, ensuring smooth animation.

## Installation

To run the simulation locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Interact with the simulation using your mouse to see the rope-like structure in action.
